# Multithread IO

This is a program that reads a file, modifies its content in a multi-threaded manner and writes the modified content back to the file (overwrites it). The modifications performed on the file include converting all the lines to uppercase, replacing all occurrences of ‘ ’ (whitespace) character with ‘_’, and writing the modified content back to the file. Pthread library is used in order to initiliaze threads.
